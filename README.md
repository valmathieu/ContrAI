# ContrAI üÉèü§ñ

**ContrAI is an open-source project dedicated to exploring the strategic depth of the French card game *la contr√©e* (also known as *la coinche*) through statistical analysis and the development of a competitive artificial intelligence.**

This repository is a comprehensive toolkit for players, developers, and researchers interested in this classic trick-taking game.

## Core Goals

- **Game Engine:** To build a robust and accurate game engine that enforces the rules of *la contr√©e*, including bidding, announcements, and scoring.
- **Statistical Analysis:** To develop tools to analyze game data, calculate probabilities (e.g., hand distribution, contract success rates), and uncover optimal strategies.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** To create a high-performing AI player using modern algorithms (such as Monte-Carlo Tree Search and reinforcement learning) capable of challenging human players.

Whether you want to improve your game, analyze probabilities, or contribute to building a world-class card game AI, your contributions are welcome!
