"""Tests for ``Round._get_playable_cards`` — the legality oracle.

The rules under test come from ``contree-domain.md`` §6.2-§6.3:

    1. Follow suit if possible.
    2. When trump is led, over-trump if you hold a higher trump than
       the highest already played; otherwise any trump.
    3. When you cannot follow suit and your partner is *not* currently
       master of the trick, you must trump (and over-trump opponents
       if able).
    4. Partner-master exemption: if your partner is currently winning
       the trick, you may discard freely.
    5. Otherwise discard.

These tests build a minimal ``Round`` with a hand-picked trick state
and ask for the legal-play set. They avoid the full ``manage_bidding``
+ ``play_all_tricks`` path so the oracle's branches can be exercised
in isolation.
